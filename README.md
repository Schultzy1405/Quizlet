# Our Quizlet Project

## Exercise details
 
when We created this website we thought about different ways on  be able to pass the time and kill  boredom. Throughout the we thought about two things people love laughing and doing trivia. So we decided to put both hand and hand and created a trivia quizlet website  with a sprinkle of jokes and who better to  make fun of  chuck  norris the man himself. 

### Part 1
 Part one of the process was creating this fantastic website was developing a starter page. During the process our team decided to the create a page that allows the user to create a username and give the user the ability to choose what type of trivia game they would like to play. We also  gave the user the ability to choose how many questions they would like during their knowledge able journey. Once the user input those features he is taken to a quiz page.


### Part 2
 Part 2 of designing our quiz page was be able to retrive the data that the user gave us and use that data to generate a nice and state of the art trivia game for them. Once you look on  the screen you are able to see the user name that they provided, the catagory title as well and as their answer selection. Other features that are on this website are a very fashionable background and very fashionable styling layout. Once the quiz is finished the user is showns its final score.

### languages used to build this website

While building this website our team used 2 different HTMl  files one for the quiz and one for the index. We also  used CSS for the fashionable styling aspect. The index and quiz each used different types of styling. And the last language our team used was one of the most important languages to this project which  was Java-script. Most of the hours for this project was put into the java-script fill because without java-script this website would not work.
